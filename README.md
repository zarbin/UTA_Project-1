###  Overview
Our objective is to see if the Fed raising of rates is having an impact on real estate markets particularly the greater Austin, TX area.   Many know Austin, and other major metropolitan real estate markets, have been hot and a sellers market the last few years.  Real estate prices have been going up, mortgage originations and refinances have been high, and inventory in real estate is low.  Inflation in 2022 and other macroeconomic factors have contributed to the Fed raising interest rates, from historic lows, to numbers we have not seen in well over a decade.  Is this having an impact in real estate and what might the trend be in 2023?  

**Hypothesis**  - Fed rate incrases are impacting the Austin real estate market by slowing it down.
