###  Overview
Our objective is to see if the Fed raising of rates is having an impact on real estate markets like Austin, TX.   Many know Austin, and other major metropolitin real estate markets have been hot the last few years.  Real estate prices have been going up, mortgage originations and refinances have been high, and inventory in real estate low.  The current talk of inflation in 2022 and other macroeconomic factors have contributed to the Fed raising interest rates, from historic lows, to numbers we have not seen in well over a decade.  Is this having an impact in real estate and what might the trend be in 2023?  

###  Outcomes
1.	Display a trend line of prices across different types of residential properties -  SFR, Condo, townhomes. 
2.	Sales - Above listing price/below sales price.
3.	Impact of Fed rate hike on housing prices.
